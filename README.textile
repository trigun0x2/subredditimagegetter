h1. SubReddit Image Getter

Takes the subreddit link and get the subreddit name and image.

Friend was asked to do this as part of her interview process so I thought I'd make one for fun.

h2. To Do:

-Model validate if the link is a reddit link.

-Ajaxify EVERYTHINGGGGGG because I can.

-Loads too slow... (using very shitty method of getting image and subreddit title because I was in a rush)
